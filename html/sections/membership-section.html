        <h2>How to Join?</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t accept random applications. If you're interested, the first step is to reach out and introduce yourself.
          This is followed by a conversation with a current member, where we assess alignment with our values and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we see potential, an invitation to a trial event will be extended.
          After the event, the community collectively decides whether an individual is the right fit.
          We focus on quality, not numbers — ensuring every member brings value and ambition to the group.
