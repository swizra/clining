                    We donâ€™t accept random applications. If you are interested in becoming part of our community, the first step is to reach out and introduce yourself. 
                    A conversation with a current member follows, where we assess alignment with our values and goals. 
                        </p>     <p> 
                    If we see potential, an invitation to a trial event will be extended. 
                    After the event, the community collectively decides whether an individual is the right fit. 
                    We are not focused on numbers but on quality, ensuring that every member brings value and ambition to the group.
